# PIA17936
99 million miles away, a camera blinked.

80 minutes after sunset on the 529th sol, the Mars Curiosity rover's left eye camera of her Mastcam captured the photo known as PIA17936. If one were standing there on that day, a human would see Earth and the moon as the brightest stars in the night sky.

This theme is designed with the colors and tones from this image. It's a subtle and low contrast, easy on the eyes, dark theme inspired by the wonders of space.

This theme was inspired by the excellent theme [Starry Night](https://github.com/JerryGoodwill/vscode-theme-starry-night) by Jerry Goodwill.
